# React Refactoring Task

## Goal

Improve an existing React component by making it cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient, **without changing its
current functionality**.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Convert to Functional Components (if needed)

- Rewrite class components as **functional components**.
- Use React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` instead of `this.state` and lifecycle methods.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Before (class)
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    state = {count: 0};

    render() {
        return <div>{this.state.count}</div>;
    }
}

// After (functional)
const MyComponent = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return <div>{count}</div>;
};
```

### 2. Make State Immutable

- Avoid mutating arrays or objects directly (`push`, `splice`, direct assignment).
- Use immutable operations like `map`, `filter`, `concat`, or spread syntax (`...`).

**Example:**

```jsx
// Bad
todos.push(newTodo);

// Good
setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
```

### 3. Split Into Smaller Components

- Identify logical parts of the UI that can become **separate components**.
- Examples: `TodoItem`, `TodoInput`, `TodoList`.
- Pass only necessary props to child components.

### 4. Optimize Rendering

- Use `React.memo` for child components that do not need to re-render on every parent update.
- Use `useCallback` for functions passed to child components.
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations inside render. In most cases, useMemo is not necessary unless the computation is expensive or youâ€™re memoizing referential equality for child components. For class names, small conditions, or string concatenations, plain inline computation is faster and cleaner.

**Example:**

```jsx
const TodoItem = React.memo(({todo, onDelete}) => (
    <li>{todo}
        <button onClick={onDelete}>Delete</button>
    </li>
));

const handleDelete = useCallback((index) => {
    setTodos(todos => todos.filter((_, i) => i !== index));
}, []);
```

### 5. Clean Code & Best Practices

- Use modern ES6+ syntax (`arrow functions`, `destructuring`, `template literals`).
- Minimize deeply nested JSX and duplicate logic.
- Use clear variable and function names.
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility.

### 6. Preserve Functionality

- Ensure the refactored component behaves **exactly the same** as before.
- Do not change UI behavior or business logic.

This guide ensures the refactoring is safe, modern, and follows React best practices, suitable for automated or manual
refactoring.
